1.) Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that creates tailored financial plans for customers, covering savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They seek to modernize their operations by enhancing their RESTful API and incorporating the latest software security measures to protect against external threats. 

2.) The thing I feel I did best when finding vulnerabilities was properly create a defense strategy to mitigate the risks associated. I have a solid understanding of how to generate a vulnerability report and how to sort of analyze it. 

3.) The most challenging part is analyzing the report. I can generate the report with no issues but understanding what the report is telling me is the part that I am still learning and trying to get better at. 

4.) To increase layers of security I added custom certificates and used a full 256-bit encryption. In the future I would utilize the vulnerability report in conjunction with recommnedations from a security expert service like NASA or NIST.

5.) The way to confirm the code is secure is to first make sure it runs error free. Then you need to run the vulnerability test and ensure there are no serious vulnerabilities. Lastly, you want to check that all inputs and outputs for your program are securely wrapped and have proper checks. 

6.) The best resource to use is to refer back to the basics. As you code you want to run your program and check your for any bugs after every single change. This significantly reduces the risks of very hard bugs to detect being wedged deep into your program due to lack of regular code checking. 

7.) I would show them my ability to generate vulnerability reports. By the point I am looking for an employer I believe after my practice up to that point I would be able to also accurately and fully understand the report.
